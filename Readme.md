# 🎮 Decentralized Esports Economy  
🚀 Empowering Players, Teams, and Developers in a Transparent Esports Ecosystem  

## 📖 Overview  
The **Decentralized Esports Economy** is a blockchain-powered governance model that enables **fair decision-making** in the esports industry. By decentralizing control, **players, teams, and developers** actively participate in shaping the esports landscape.  

This ensures **fairness, sustainability, and inclusivity** while eliminating centralized control over critical aspects like:  
- Revenue distribution  
- Voting mechanisms  
- Policy creation  

### **Cross-Game Asset Marketplace**  
A major innovation of this system is the **Cross-Game Asset Marketplace**, which allows players to **trade digital assets (NFTs, skins, collectibles) across multiple games**, breaking ecosystem silos and enabling a truly **player-driven gaming economy**.
